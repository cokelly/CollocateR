\usage{
get_freqs(doc, keyword, window = 6, ngram = 1, min_count = 2,
  cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{doc}{A character vector or list of character vectors}

\item{keyword}{A key word or phrase to test}

\item{window}{The number of context words to be displayed around the keyword Default 6}

\item{ngram}{The size of phrases the frequencies of which we are to test (so, unigram = 1, bigram = 2, trigram = 3 etc)}

\item{min_count}{Collocates that occur fewer times than floor will be removed}

\item{cache}{Getting frequencies is the most time-consuming step in calculating frequencies and other collocation algorithms. The memoise package is used to cache specific iterations of this process. Default FALSE.}

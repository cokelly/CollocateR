\title{A t-score calculates a probability score that compares the observed collocate frequency to its expected value}
\usage{
t_score(document, pattern, window = 5, ngram = 1, floor = 3,
  remove_stopwords = TRUE, remove_numerals = TRUE, cache = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{document}{A character vector or list of character vectors}

\item{pattern}{A character vector containing a keyword}

\item{window}{The number of context words to be displayed around the keyword Default 5}

\item{ngram}{The size of phrases the frequencies of which we are to test (so, unigram = 1, bigram = 2, trigram = 3 etc)}

\item{remove_stopwords}{Remove stopwords from the document (based on tidytext's stopwords data). Default TRUE.}

\item{remove_numerals}{Remove numerals}

\item{cache}{Organising collocates is the most time-consuming step in calculating frequencies and other collocation algorithms. The memoise package is used to cache specific iterations of this process. Default FALSE.}
